 <h1>Blockchain</h1>   
 <hr>
 <p>From wikipedia,the<em>free </em></p>
 <p><i>For other uses, see Block chain (disambiguation).</i></p>
 <p>A <strong>blockchain</strong> is a <mark>distributed ledger</mark> with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely<del>linked</del> comprises together via cryptographic hashes.<sup>[1][2][3][4] </sup>Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.</p><br><p>Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.<sup>[5]</sup></p>

 <p>Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups."<sup>[10]</sup> Further work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.<sup>[4][11]</sup> They wanted to implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.<sup>[4][12]</sup> Under their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been published in The New York Times every week since 1995.<sup>[13]</sup></p>
 
 <br>
 <p>The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to timestamp blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize the rate at which blocks are added to the chain.[4] The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network.<sup>[3]</sup></p>

 <h2>Supply Chain</h2>
 <p>There have been several different efforts to employ blockchains in supply chain management.</p>
 <ul>
    <li><h3>Precious commodities mining-</h3><p> Blockchain technology has been used for tracking the origins of gemstones and other precious commodities. In 2016, The Wall Street Journal reported that the blockchain technology company Everledger was partnering with IBM's blockchain-based tracking service to trace the origin of diamonds to ensure that they were ethically mined.[111] As of 2019, the Diamond Trading Company (DTC) has been involved in building a diamond trading supply chain product called Tracer.[112]</p></li>
    <li><h3>Food supply-</h3><p>As of 2018, Walmart and IBM were running a trial to use a blockchain-backed system for supply chain monitoring for lettuce and spinach â€” all nodes of the blockchain were administered by Walmart and were located on the IBM cloud.[113]</p></li>
    <li><h3>Fashion industry -</h3><p>There is an opaque relationship between brands, distributors, and customers in the fashion industry, which will prevent the sustainable and stable development of the fashion industry. Blockchain makes up for this shortcoming and makes information transparent, solving the difficulty of sustainable development of the industry.[114]</p></li>
    <li><h3>Motor vehicles-</h3><p> Mercedes-Benz and partner Icertis developed a blockchain prototype used to facilitate consistent documentation of contracts along the supply chain so that the ethical standards and contractual obligations required of its direct suppliers can be passed on to second tier suppliers and beyond.[115][116] In another project, the company uses blockchain technology to track the emissions of climate-relevant gases and the amount of secondary material along the supply chain for its battery cell manufacturers.[117]</p></li>
